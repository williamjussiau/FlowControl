## Short-term

# doc
# type annotations

# MIMO support u_ctrl = list() -> probably not difficult to take into account???
# + both kinds of actuation -> probably need "if" statements



## Mid-term
# sort (& check & rm) utility funs (_flowsolver, _extract, _debug)

# cavity
# and why not cylinder with volume force (would work with MIMO/actuation support)

# get A, B, C -> (more) general form?




## Long-term
# Add tests to Controller (stepping, add/mul)
# write_timeseries -> async?
# test parallel


# CRITICAL NOTE TO SELF:
# do not do:
# u, p = up.split(deepcopy=False)
# write(u)
# write(p)
# because it somewhat messes up the FunctionSpaces apparently
