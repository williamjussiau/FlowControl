## Short-term
# doc

# MIMO support u_ctrl = list() -> probably not difficult
# + both kinds of actuation -> probably need "if" treatment

# docker



## Mid-term
# sort (& check & rm) utility funs (_flowsolver, _extract, _debug)

# reimplement cavity
# and why not cylinder with volume force (would work with MIMO/actuation support)

# get A, B, C -> (more) general form?




## Long-term
# add tests to Controller (stepping, add/mul)
# write_timeseries -> async?
# test parallel
