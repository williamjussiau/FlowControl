## Short-term

# subfields .time, .fem, .control, .geometry, .primitives?
# in geometry, add dict lim["xinf"], lim["xinfa"] (user-defined)?
# + FlowField current (u,p,up)?

# sub classes for rendre flowsolver less big?

# doc & type annotations

# get A, B, C -> can do general form?

## Mid-term
# sort utility funs (_flowsolver, _extract, _debug)

# MIMO support
# + both kinds of actuation -> probably need "if" statements

# Add tests to Controller (stepping, add/mul)


## Long-term
# write_timeseries -> async somehow?
# test parallel
