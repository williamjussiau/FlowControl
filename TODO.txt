## Short-term
# Docker/venv/pip

# standardize initial_guess of Picard & Newton

# in Controller.inv -> replicate self.x0 as well?


## Mid-term
# sort (& check & rm) utility funs (_flowsolver, _extract, _debug)

# get A, B, C -> general form

# (why not reimplement cylinder with volume force)


## Long-term
# unit tests
# test parallel -> peval Sensor, broadcast measurement
# write_timeseries -> async?
