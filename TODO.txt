## Short-term
# Docker/venv/pip

## Mid-term
# sort (& check & rm) utility funs (_flowsolver, _extract, _debug)

# get A, B, C -> (more) general form?

# (why not reimplement cylinder with volume force)


## Long-term
# add tests
# test parallel -> peval Sensor, broadcast measurement
# write_timeseries -> async?
