Configuration
===========================================

These instructions are only relevant to those who want to change the module dependencies in the source code and need to create a new Makefile.

1. Install creamake from https://sourceforge.net/projects/creamake/ 

2. Modify the file configure/creamake.<compiler>.<os>.xml where 
   - <compiler> can be "gfortran" or "ifort" and 
   - <os> can be "linux", "windows" or "osx-<version>".

3. Open a Terminal in GNU/Linux or a Command Window in Windows; type in installation folder: 

   creamake configure/creamake.<compiler>.<os>
  
A new Makefile should appear in the installation folder.

4. Move Makefile to Makefile.<compiler>.<os>
